Despite Tfl&apos;s best efforts, you&apos;ve made it to Russell square tube station in one piece and only slightly behind schedule. You&apos;re a short walk away from the Developer Happiness Days event or Dev8D as it is usually known. It&apos;s taking place in the University of London Union (ULU) building and, if it is anything like it was last year, it will not only be great fun, but you&apos;ll meet lots of new people who you really want to meet but don&apos;t know it yet, you&apos;ll be introduced to new, potentially unknown and exciting software and even learn a few fresh tricks about dealing with the software you are already using.

You walk out from Russell Square station, pull up your phone and load up the directions to the ULU entrance. You walk along for a few minutes, staring down, tracking your progress with your phone. It isn&apos;t long before you approach the front door and have to pass by the throng of Smoking students to walk inside.

Dev8D
A day at Dev8D by Ben O&apos;Steen
Release 1 / Serial number 120129 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

ULU Entrance
You look around the foyer, scanning across the faces of the various students sat, engrossed in their laptops. You notice a small A4 sign for Dev8D on the north wall. To the west is a snack shop, selling all sorts of sweets, sandwiches and hot drinks. At least, it would be if it were open. There is a small lift to the north, but that is being used to take boxes of drinks upstairs. A lot of drinks.

You see an unmanned trestle table sagging with the weight of a huge pile - no, a mountain - of flyers, the lower reaches of which are decorated with toy figures. Someone has attempted to make the table and everything on it look old and dusty, but with the handicap of using only glitter, tinsel and coloured paper.

An old lamp sits nestled within a valley of paper. Unlike most of the other items on the table, the lamp looks old simply because it is. For some reason, a slightly warped plastic arrow is also on the table, positioned as if it is important. There is a red fish almost buried in glitter next to it on the table. Why someone would use so much glitter isn&apos;t obvious, unless they are doing it as a (thinly-veiled) cry for help. A shiny red keycard pokes out from underneath the fish. You note that it has somehow remained glitter-free.

You can see a dusty table (on which is a pile of flyers) here.

Exits: north.

Ground floor stairs
In the low-light of the stairwell, you see a set of sharp-angled stairs spiralling upwards, fenced in by a utilitarian handrail, supported by thin banisters. The parts of the walls you can see are the kind of beige colour that cannot be described accurately without the words &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;depressing&quot;. It won&apos;t be how the colour is officially labelled, but labels are rarely honest. The noise from the rest of the building provides a background hum of activity. 

The only way is UP! (or something like that.) 

There is a message board lining the walls of the stairwell.

Exits: up and south to ULU Entrance.

A spiralling staircase, hemmed in by harsh railings and beige walls. The noise from the rest of the building provides a background hum of activity.

You see that the Gallery bar is north through the double doors, but now is no time to take a drink. You can go down to the ground floor or up a few flights to the third floor, which is where most of Dev8D will take place.

You turn left into a small open area alongside a beige-coloured corridor, the same disappointing shade as that used in the stairwell. There is a busy woman sat behind a cluttered desk. To the south you can see the doors to rooms 3C and 3D.  The corridor continues east towards a set of closed doors, and west, towards what sounds like the rest of the conference.

You can see a busy woman here.

Exits: east, west, north to Third floor stairs, southeast and southwest.

You can hear a murmur coming from the west. It sounds like everyone is down that way You&apos;d better hurry.

You enter the door and come face-to-face (well, face-to-back) with a crowd of people, all of whom are looking intently towards the other side of the room. It seems that things are just about to start, so you press forward to get a decent enough view. You manoeuvre through the throng of developers, hackers, academics and other delegates as politely as you can until you manage to get a view of the organiser who is just about to speak.

&quot;Welcome! Thank you all for coming to this, the fourth Dev8D! Yes, fourth! I&apos;m so glad to see lots of new faces out there, standing amongst the faces I already know well! You know, helping people meet up and talk about the things that interest or even stump you is one of the key reasons this event exists. Many of you work in small teams and can feel isolated. Sometimes you alone are the team!&quot;

You hear quite a few knowing laughs from the people in the crowd. Seems you aren&apos;t alone here after all.

The shop is still closed it seems and the Sisyphean challenge of keeping the bar stocked with booze and J20 is still ongoing. Students are still quietly working and chatting in the seated area.

You see a flimsy, trestle table - weighed down with a pile of retro-game flyers - that someone has attempted to make look dusty and old with the handicap of using only glitter, tinsel and coloured paper.

Perched amongst the flyers, you see an old lamp. For some reason, a slightly warped plastic arrow is also on the table. You also spot a red fish sprinkled with glitter. It is not obvious why someone has done this unless it&apos;s a desperate cry for help. A shiny red keycard is poking out from underneath the fish.

It looks like an old Davy lamp, covered with joke-shop cobwebs and glitter.

&gt;[2] x lamp
 It looks like it hasn&apos;t been lit in very long time. You notice a small plaque around the bottom edge of the lamp

You are able to rub some debris from the plaque, revealing this message: &quot;For use when presented by a maze of twisty little passages, all alike&quot;.

You can&apos;t see any such thing.

&gt;[4] x miscellaneous posters
It looks like someone loaded a shotgun with dozens of fonts, colours and jarring designs and shot it repeatedly at the wall. 

There are party flyers advertising certain DJs playing in certain venues which, as you have no idea who the DJs are, fails to get you interested. You see some notices about various sports clubs, at which point your eyes glaze over and involuntarily, you start to read from the next poster, which seems to have something about student welfare on it. None of the posters seem to contain important information. Only the strange zelda poster that you noticed before that is of interest to you.

&gt;[5] x poster
The sheet is a scene from the very first Zelda game. Above an old man who is standing between two bright red blocky fires is text that reads: &quot;It is dangerous to go alone. Take this!&quot;. The bottom of the sheet has been cut into little strips that you can pull off. Printed onto each is an orange sword, the master sword from the game. 

Neat.

Even though It&apos;s not that dangerous to go alone, you tear the strip from the bottom of the poster. 

Scaredy cat.

&gt;[9] x stairwell
You see nothing special about the Main Stairwell.

&gt;[10] listen to stairwell
Chattering voices from all floors are funnelled and compressed together with the footsteps of people in this stairwell. The sounds bounce and rebound along the walls, turning into a generic murmur of activity, with no one sound being distinguishable from the next..

You already have that.

A B C D E F G H I...
A B C D E F G H I...

By shifting the second row to the right or left by some number of letters, say, 3 letters to the right, you can create a caesar cipher encoder:

A B C D E F G H I...
X Y Z A B C D E F...
(Note that the letters wrap around.)

 To encode a letter, you find it on the top row and use the letter under it. In this way, BED becomes YBA, HAG becomes EXD and so on. ROT-13 (&quot;rotate by 13&quot;) is a well known variation on the caesar cipher. Pretty easy to code a ROT in python too.

    def encode(txt, n): return &quot;&quot;.join([chr((ord(c)-ord(&quot;a&quot;)+n) % 26 + ord(&quot;a&quot;)) for c in txt.lower()])

You enter the door and come face-to-face (well, face-to-back) with a crowd of people, all of whom are looking intently towards the other side of the room.

You can see Mahendra Mahey here.

Exits: south to Corridor - Westmost.

It seems that things are just about to start, so you press forward to get a decent enough view. You manoeuvre through the throng of developers, hackers, academics and other delegates as politely as you can until you manage to get a view of the organiser who is just about to speak.

&quot;Welcome! Thank you all for coming to this, the fourth Dev8D! The fourth! There are a lot of new faces out there which is excellent, great to see and I also see many people I&apos;ve met before, which is doubly excellent! Helping people meet up and talk about the things that interest them or even stump them is why we are here. Many of you work in small teams of developers - sometimes, it&apos;s just you! It is easy to feel isolated as you tackle problems on your own. Sometimes, you are trying to fix the problems you caused trying to fix the first time around!&quot;

You hear quite a few knowing laughs from the people in the crowd. Seems you aren&apos;t alone here after all.

He continues. &quot;This conference runs a little differently to what you might have experienced at other events. The focus in on practical skills, so the hands-on sessions outnumber the death-by-powerpoint talks.&quot; He turns round, and you catch a glimpse through the crowd of the schedule projected against the wall. Pointing at this, he says &quot;The day starts formally, with workshops and talks targeted at what we feel are core skills. Lunch follows this, which is a perfect time to meet other people who might be working in the same areas or have the same interests as you. Then, there is the section focussed on emerging technologies - that is, things you might not be using right now but really should know about for the future. And then there is the final part of the day which is all about pushing the ideas of the day further. This will run a little differently to normal.&quot;

Even with the limited view of the schedule that you have, you can still see that unlike the other sections of the day, this one is oddly empty.

&quot;The purpose of the event is to work for you, everyone here&quot; he says, pointing at the crowd. &quot;The day, as with other conferences, starts off with our best guess at the kinds of topics you want to learn about.&quot;

&quot;The difference is that we want it to end with the sessions you want.&quot;

The crowd has gone quiet. You can&apos;t tell whether it&apos;s from confusion at the idea or they are still in a zombie-like morning daze.

He points at the back of the room &quot;You might&apos;ve seen the board at the back of the room as you walked in. It has the schedule, but more importantly, it has space to write ideas on. These should be the ideas you want taken further, birds-of-a-feather meetings, impromptu workshops, discussions about the ideas raised by the lightning talks you have heard, code-reviews meetups, knitting circles, reruns of earlier sessions because you managed to convince the workshop trainer to do so... in short, make it the event you want.&quot;

You notice people talking around you, no doubt conspiring with one another about what session they&apos;d like to run. Someone in the crowd to your left shouts out &quot;Skyrim!&quot;, followed by loud chuckles from a number of people in the crowd.

You look back towards the front to see the speaker laughing as well. &quot;Yes, I&apos;ve been sucked into that too. I tell you what, you can put up a Skyrim Anonymous session, as an intervention to help us all break the addiction!&quot;

&quot;We have a limited number of slots available in the main rooms for this, so it will not be a first-come-first-serve arrangement. You can put your Skyrim idea up there, but you will need people to vote for it for it to get a slot. We are going to try &quot;dotmocracy&quot;, where using a whiteboard marker, you simply put one dot next to the session you want to happen. You&apos;ll each have three dots to place each day. We are all adults here... well, most of us are, so I&apos;m leaving it up to your own sense of honour to only vote three times.&quot;

He points towards the back of the room again. &quot;The running schedule for the last part of the day will be written up and fixed in place a little while before we start it, so make sure you suggest ideas or vote before then!&quot;

Corridor - West
You walk on, towards the noise. You can see that the corridor continues north, before turning west again. The entrance to room 3E is to the south.

Exits: east to Corridor - Middle, north and south.

A small group of students, talking loudly, pass by you on their way to the stairs.

This part of the corridor narrows slightly and snakes around a corner where it ends. The set of double doors to the north lead to the Basecamp.

You enter the door and come face-to-face (well, face-to-back) with a crowd of people, all of whom are looking intently towards the other side of the room.

You can see Mahendra Mahey here.

Exits: south to Corridor - Westmost.

It seems that things are just about to start, so you press forward to get a decent enough view. You manoeuvre through the throng of developers, hackers, academics and other delegates as politely as you can until you manage to get a view of the organiser who is just about to speak.

&quot;Welcome! Thank you all for coming to this, the fourth Dev8D! The fourth! There are a lot of new faces out there which is excellent, great to see and I also see many people I&apos;ve met before, which is doubly excellent! Helping people meet up and talk about the things that interest them or even stump them is why we are here. Many of you work in small teams of developers - sometimes, it&apos;s just you! It is easy to feel isolated as you tackle problems on your own. Sometimes, you are trying to fix the problems you caused trying to fix the first time around!&quot;

You hear quite a few knowing laughs from the people in the crowd. Seems you aren&apos;t alone here after all.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Imagine the alphabet you want to use written out twice, one row above another. For example :

A B C D E F G H I...
A B C D E F G H I...

By shifting the second row to the right or left by some number of letters, say, 3 letters to the right, you can create a caesar cipher encoder:

A B C D E F G H I...
X Y Z A B C D E F...
(Note that the letters wrap around.)

 To encode a letter, you find it on the top row and use the letter under it. In this way, BED becomes YBA, HAG becomes EXD and so on. ROT-13 (&quot;rotate by 13&quot;) is a well known variation on the caesar cipher. Pretty easy to code a ROT in python too.

BASECAMP DESC.

On the refreshments table is tea, coffee and a snack buffet. A selection of different types of snacks piled high - mainly muffins. In fact, on closer inspection, it looks like a muffin re-enactment of the Ambassador&apos;s Ferraro Rocher pyramid.

You turn left into a small open area alongside a beige-coloured corridor, the same disappointing shade as that used in the stairwell. There is a busy woman sat behind a cluttered desk. To the south you can see the doors to rooms 3C and 3D.  The corridor continues east towards a set of closed doors, and west, towards what sounds like the rest of the conference.

You follow the corridor along a little further, and reach some closed doors that block your progress. You note that as the doors to 3A and 3B are along the southern wall here, you won&apos;t need to go any further along in any case. You become acutely aware of the lack of natural light, as everything has gained a light yellow tone from the fluorescent lighting. The entrances to the male and female toilets are on the north wall.

You can&apos;t see any such thing.

&gt;[4] x miscellaneous posters
It looks as if someone loaded a shotgun with hundreds of fonts, colours and jarring designs and fired it at the wall. Lots of special announcements regarding certain DJs playing in certain venues which, as you know neither the DJs nor the venues, fails to get you interested. You see some notices about various sports clubs, at which point your eyes glaze over. Involuntarily, your eyes move  to look at the next poster which has something to do with student welfare. None of these posters seem to contain important information. and it&apos;s only the strange zelda poster you noticed before that is keeping your attention.

&gt;[5] x poster
The sheet is a scene from the very first Zelda game. Above an old man who is standing between two bright red blocky fires is text that reads: &quot;It is dangerous to go alone. Take this!&quot;. The bottom of the sheet has been cut into little strips that you can pull off. Printed onto each is an orange sword, the master sword from the game. Neat.

You see nothing special about the master sword paper strip.

Even thought It&apos;s not that dangerous too alone, you tear the strip from the bottom of the poster. Scaredy cat.

You see nothing special about the Main Stairwell.

&gt;[10] listen to stairwell
Chattering voices from all floors are funnelled and compressed together with the footsteps of people in this stairwell. The sounds bounce and rebound along the walls, turning into a generic murmur of activity, with no one sound being distinguishable from the next..

&gt;[11] take strip
You already have that.

&gt;[12] drop strip
Dropped.

&gt;[13] take strip
Taken.

In the low-light of the stairwell, you see a set of sharp-angled stairs spiralling upwards, fenced in by a utilitarian handrail, supported by thin banisters. The parts of the walls you can see are the kind of beige colour that cannot be described accurately without the words &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;depressing&quot;. It won&apos;t be how the colour is officially labelled, but labels are rarely honest. The noise from the rest of the building provides a background hum of activity.

 You see that the Gallery bar is north through the double doors. You can go down to the ground floor or up a few flights to the third floor, which is where most of Dev8D will take place.

ULU Entrance
The shop is still closed it seems and the Sisyphean challenge of keeping the bar stocked with booze and J20 is still ongoing. Students are still quietly working and chatting in the seated area.

You see a flimsy, trestle table - weighed down with a pile of retro-game flyers - that someone has attempted to make look dusty and old with the handicap of using only glitter, tinsel and coloured paper.

Perched amongst the flyers, you see an old lamp. For some reason, a slightly warped plastic arrow is also on the table. You also spot a red fish sprinkled with glitter. It is not obvious why someone has done this unless it&apos;s a desperate cry for help.

Exits: north to Ground floor stairs.

 You see that the Gallery bar is north through the double doors. You can go down to the ground floor or up a few flights to the third floor.

Exits: down to Ground floor stairs, north and south to the Duck &amp; Dive Bar.

Basecamp
You enter the door and come face-to-face (well, face-to-back) with a crowd of people, all of whom are looking intently towards the other side of the room.

Exits: south to Corridor - Westmost.

It seems that things are just about to start, so you press forward to get a decent enough view. You manoeuvre through the throng of developers, hackers, academics and other delegates as politely as you can until you manage to get a view of the organiser who is just about to speak.

&quot;Welcome! Thank you all for coming to this, the fourth Dev8D! Yes, fourth! I&apos;m so glad to see lots of new faces out there, standing amongst the faces I already know well! You know, helping people meet up and talk about the things that interest or even stump you is one of the key reasons this event exists. Many of you work in small teams and can feel isolated. Sometimes you alone are the team!&quot;

You hear quite a few knowing laughs from the people in the crowd. Seems you aren&apos;t alone here after all. (Maybe you should put that master sword back where you found it, eh?).

You spill quite a bit of tea down your front as you bite and chew into the paper cup. You attempt to drink it instead. 
You take a long slurp of tea. Lovely, lovely tea. Perfect. It&apos;s a shame the cups are so small!

ULU Entrance
ULU GROUND FLOOR DESCRIPTION.

In the foyer, you see a flimsy table - weighed down with a pile of retro-game flyers - that someone has attempted to make look dusty and old with the handicap of using only glitter, tinsel and coloured paper.  Perched amongst the flyers, you see an old lamp.

Exits: north.

&gt;[2] x table
On the dusty table are an old lamp here and a retro-game flyer pile.

&gt;[3] x glitter
Glitter. Wonderful. You look forward to finding little pieces of this stuck to you for many days to come.

&gt;[4] x coloured paper
It&apos;s amazing what an artist can capture with just some scissors, glue and coloured paper. The person who decorated this table should&apos;ve given them a call.

&gt;[5] x tinsel
An unpleasant, gaudy and cheap-looking relic attached to the edges of the table in an effort to make it look more festive. You die a little inside.

&gt;[6] x retro-game flyers
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the retro-game flyer pile.

&gt;[7] take flyer
You take one of the concertina&apos;d flyers from the stack.

&gt;[8] x flyer
(the poorly printed flyer)
The title of the flyer is &quot;GET LAMP - Interactive fiction in the 21st century!&quot;. Further down the page you see an apology for stealing the flyer&apos;s title from &quot;Jason&apos;s (@textfiles) awesome upcoming documentary, can&apos;t wait!!!&quot;. Hmm.

You read a passage about how graphical interfaces destroy the imagination. You stifle a laugh, knowing that whoever wrote this likely made it using MS Word. Mainly because of the overuse of Papyrus, Comic-sans and *scoff* Ariel.

    <result xml:space="preserve">For those new to text adventures - Don&apos;t Panic! It&apos;s quite simple, once you get comfortable and learn that the flashing cursor is your friend.

All the action takes place in rooms. You can move from one room to another with a simple command like Go north or even just n. The game doesn&apos;t really care about the case of commands, so don&apos;t worry about that either. Many help pages online will use CAPITAL LETTERS to show things you type in, but it doesn&apos;t affect anything to use lower or even mixed-case.

Moving within a room isn&apos;t necessary - you don&apos;t need to approach a buffet table to take something from it - the game handles that sort of thing for you. Stick to short english commands and if you can see it, you can interact with it.

Compass directions are used to move around but the exits from a room are listed in this game, so you shouldn&apos;t have to make any maps. In fact, as this is based on the ULU venue itself, you might find decent maps of the place online!

Try to interact with your surroundings, for example:
&gt; EXAMINE TABLE
&gt; ASK BEN ABOUT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
&gt; DRINK COFFEE
&gt; READ FLYER
 and of course
&gt; GET LAMP)

Other words to try:
PICK UP, PUT, DROP {something}, GET {something}, TAKE{something}
LOOK or EXAMINE {something}
INVENTORY
WAIT or Z

Many commands have abbreviated forms. You can use &quot;X&quot; instead of &quot;EXAMINE&quot;, &quot;I&quot; instead of &quot;INVENTORY&quot;, and the short-forms of the compass directions (&quot;s&quot;,&quot;se&quot;, etc) to &quot;GO&quot; in that direction.

&gt;[1] look
ULU Entrance
.

In the foyer, you see a flimsy table - weighed down with a pile of retro-game flyers - that someone has attempted to make look dusty and old with the handicap of using only glitter, tinsel and coloured paper.  Perched amongst the flyers, you see an old lamp.

Exits: north.

&gt;[2] x table
A flimsy table - weighed down with a pile of retro-game flyers - that someone has attempted to make look dusty and old with the handicap of using only glitter, tinsel and coloured paper. Perched amongst the flyers, you see an old lamp.

On the dusty table are an old lamp and a retro-game flyer pile.

&gt;[3] x glitter
Glitter. Wonderful. You look forward to finding little pieces of this stuck to you for many days to come.

&gt;[4] x coloured paper
It&apos;s amazing what an artist can capture with just some scissors, glue and coloured paper. The person who decorated this table should&apos;ve given them a call.

&gt;[5] x tinsel
An unpleasant, gaudy and cheap-looking relic attached to the edges of the table in an effort to make it look more festive. You die a little inside.

&gt;[6] x retro-game flyers
A stack of small pamphlets about the history of video games

&gt;[7] take flyer
(the retro-game flyer pile)
You shouldn&apos;t take more than one, no matter how many there are here. These have obviously been printed on a student&apos;s budget!

&gt;[8] x flyer
(the poorly printed flyer)
The title of the flyer is &quot;GET LAMP - Interactive fiction in the 21st century!&quot;. Further down the page you see an apology for stealing the flyer&apos;s title from &quot;Jason&apos;s (@textfiles) awesome upcoming documentary, can&apos;t wait!!!&quot;. Hmm.

&gt;[9] x flyer
(the poorly printed flyer)
(An uninspiring photo of a smartphone running some sort of terminal application.) You guess this must be interesting for some reason you cannot fathom as the caption text under it uses a lot of exclamation marks.

&gt;[10] x flyer
(the poorly printed flyer)
&quot;Our Favourite Interactive Fiction games! (Check them out on IFDB) 

 - Blue Lacuna by Aaron A. Reed (Phenomenal!!)
 - Any and all of the Zork games
 - Vicious Cycles (http://bloomengine.com/cycles)
 - Photopia by Adam Cadre (strange and beautiful!)
 - Galatea by Emily Short
 - Ecdysis by Peter Nepstad (Very Non-PG Lovecraftian horror!)
 - Lost Pig by Admiral Jota (Grunk wants pig!)
 - Bronze by Emily Short (again)
 - Collosal Cave Adventure (a classic!!)
 (... the list goes on for most of a page, with names like Emily Short, Adam Cadre, Andrew Plotkin and Aaron Reed reoccurring a few times.) 

&gt;[11] x flyer
(the poorly printed flyer)
You read a passage about how graphical interfaces destroy the imagination in children and adults. You stifle a laugh, knowing that whoever wrote this likely made it using MS Word. Mainly because of the overuse of Papyrus, Comic-sans and *scoff* Ariel.

A flimsy table - weighed down with a pile of retro-game flyers - that someone has attempted to make look dusty and old with the handicap of using only glitter, tinsel and coloured paper.

Perched amongst the flyers, you see an old lamp. For some reason, a slightly warped plastic arrow is also on the table. You also spot a red fish sprinkled with glitter. It is not obvious why someone has done this unless it&apos;s a desperate cry for help.
Exits: north.

Ground floor stairs
In the low-light of the stairwell, you see a set of sharp-angled stairs spiralling upwards, fenced in by a utilitarian handrail, supported by thin banisters. The parts of the walls you can see are the kind of beige colour that cannot be described accurately without the words &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;depressing&quot;. It won&apos;t be how the colour is officially labelled, but labels are rarely honest. The noise from the rest of the building provides a background hum of activity. 

The only way is UP! or something like that. 

There is a message board lining the walls of the stairwell.

Exits: south to ULU Entrance and up.

A spiralling staircase, hemmed in by harsh railings and beige walls. The noise from the rest of the building provides a background hum of activity.

You see that the Gallery bar is north through the double doors, but now is no time to take a drink. You can go down to the ground floor or up a few flights to the third floor, which is where most of Dev8D will take place.

You enter the door and come face-to-face (well, face-to-back) with a crowd of people, all of whom are looking intently towards the other side of the room. It seems that things are just about to start, so you press forward to get a decent enough view. You manoeuvre through the throng of developers, hackers, academics and other delegates as politely as you can until you manage to get a view of the organiser who is just about to speak.

&quot;Welcome! Thank you all for coming to this, the fourth Dev8D! Yes, fourth! I&apos;m so glad to see lots of new faces out there, standing amongst the faces I already know well! You know, helping people meet up and talk about the things that interest or even stump you is one of the key reasons this event exists. Many of you work in small teams and can feel isolated. Sometimes you alone are the team!&quot;

You hear quite a few knowing laughs from the people in the crowd. Seems you aren&apos;t alone here after all.

Ground floor stairs
In the low-light of the stairwell, you see a set of sharp-angled stairs spiralling upwards, fenced in by a utilitarian handrail, supported by thin banisters. The parts of the walls you can see are the kind of beige colour that cannot be described accurately without the words &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;depressing&quot;. It won&apos;t be how the colour is officially labelled, but labels are rarely honest. The noise from the rest of the building provides a background hum of activity. 

The only way is UP! or something like that. 

There is a message board lining the walls of the stairwell.

Exits: up and south to ULU Entrance.

You enter the door and come face-to-face (well, face-to-back) with a crowd of people, all of whom are looking intently towards the other side of the room.

Exits: south to Corridor - Westmost.

It seems that things are just about to start, so you press forward to get a decent enough view. You manoeuvre through the throng of developers, hackers, academics and other delegates as politely as you can until you manage to get a view of the organiser who is just about to speak.

&quot;Welcome! Thank you all for coming to this, the fourth Dev8D! Yes, fourth! I&apos;m so glad to see lots of new faces out there, standing amongst the faces I already know well! You know, helping people meet up and talk about the things that interest or even stump you is one of the key reasons this event exists. Many of you work in small teams and can feel isolated. Sometimes you alone are the team!&quot;

You hear quite a few knowing laughs from the people in the crowd. Seems you aren&apos;t alone here after all.

The shop is still closed it seems and the Sisyphean challenge of keeping the bar stocked with booze and J20 is still ongoing. Students are quietly working and chatting in the seated area.

You see an unmanned trestle table sagging with the weight of a huge pile of flyers. Someone has attempted to make the table and everything on it look old and dusty, but with the handicap of using only glitter, tinsel and coloured paper.

Nestled amongst the flyers, is an old lamp. Unlike most of the other items on the table, the lamp looks old simply because it is. For some reason, a slightly warped plastic arrow is also on the table. You also spot a red fish sprinkled with glitter on the table as well. Why someone would use so much glitter isn&apos;t obvious, unless it&apos;s a thinly-veiled cry for help. A shiny red keycard pokes out from underneath the fish. You note that it has somehow remained glitter-free.

You can see a dusty table (on which are an old lamp, a red fish, a shiny red keycard, and a pile of flyers) here.

He shrugs his shoulders a little. &quot;To be honest, they are all pretty much the same. Pick one, learn it by writing actual code and most importantly, find out about the libraries you should use and more importantly, the libraries you shouldn&apos;t. The best way you can do that is by chatting with your peers - you know, the people like you, doing similar things to you. You can learn the most from them.&quot;

He turns back to his laptop and opens yet another terminal on the screen - you could&apos;ve sworn you heard the laptop&apos;s fans sigh audibly. He brings up a python prompt and turns back to you. 

&quot;I have to say though, I have a real soft spot for python. Does the job, clear, easy, nice. Well worth putting time in learning. There&apos;s also javascript, which is a crucial language to know if you are building a web service.&quot;

&quot;Er... okay.&quot; You had thought he would help a little more than that. You turn to leave.

&quot;Wait! I&apos;m kidding!&quot; he says. &quot;Ordinarily I&apos;d tell you to search for that online, as you&apos;ll find some of the best material there, like &quot;Dive into Python&quot;, but look around you. There&apos;s a ton of collective python experience here, the kind of experience that make the difference between searching for hours or having an issue sorted out with a quick chat.&quot; He &quot;alt-tab&apos;s back to a browser window. &quot;In fact, I think there is a python workshop due to start soon if you are keen. It&apos;s taking place next door in room 3B. Just remember, it&apos;s the community of people that makes a language great, not the other way around. Ask questions, get involved. As with anything, you get out from it more than what you put it, but you have to put something in first!&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s a very simple code. Here, let me show you.&quot; he says, turning the laptop towards you. &quot;Imagine the alphabet you want to use written out twice, one row above another. For example:&quot; 

(on screen)
A B C D E F G H I...
A B C D E F G H I...

By shifting the second row to the right or left by some number of letters, say, 3 letters to the right, you can create a caesar cipher encoder:

A B C D E F G H I...
X Y Z A B C D E F...

He points to the screen &quot;Note how the letters wrap around here. To encode a letter, you find it on the top row and use the letter under it. In this way, BED becomes YBA, HAG becomes EXD and so on. ROT 13  or &quot;rotate by 13&quot; is a well known variation on the caesar cipher. Pretty easy to code this in python too.

&quot;Hey!&quot; An angry man shouts out at you. &quot;That&apos;s my lamp! What the hell do you think you are playing at? Give it here!&quot; He snatches the old lamp from you, and looks like he is about to erupt. Eventually, he gets himself under control and just shakes his head in frustration at you and stalks off, the lamp swinging beside him.

You are tapped on the shoulder twice, with some force behind each tap. 

You turn round to see the angry man from before &quot;You again?&quot; he says &quot;That lamp is an heirloom, it&apos;s not worth anything to anyone but me, so leave off!&quot; He grabs the lamp and walks off

    <result xml:space="preserve">ULU Entrance
The shop is still closed it seems and the Sisyphean challenge of keeping the bar stocked with booze and J20 is still ongoing. Students are quietly working and chatting in the seated area.

You see an unmanned trestle table sagging with the weight of a huge pile of flyers. Someone has attempted to make the table and everything on it look old and dusty, but with the handicap of using only glitter, tinsel and coloured paper.

Nestled amongst the flyers, is an old lamp. Unlike most of the other items on the table, the lamp looks old simply because it is. For some reason, a slightly warped plastic arrow is also on the table, positioned as if it is important. There is a red fish almost buried in glitter next to it on the table. Why someone would use so much glitter isn&apos;t obvious, unless they are doing it as a (thinly-veiled) cry for help. A shiny red keycard pokes out from underneath the fish. You note that it has somehow remained glitter-free.

You can see a dusty table (on which is a pile of flyers) here.

It seems that things are just about to start, so you press forward to get a decent enough view. You manoeuvre through the throng of developers, hackers, academics and other delegates as politely as you can until you manage to get a view of the organiser who is just about to speak.

&quot;Welcome! Thank you all for coming to this, the fourth Dev8D! Yes, fourth! I&apos;m so glad to see lots of new faces out there, standing amongst those I already know! Helping people meet up and talk about the things that interest or even stump you is one of the key reasons this event exists. Many of you work in small teams and can feel isolated. Sometimes you alone are the team!&quot;

You hear quite a few knowing laughs from the people in the crowd. Seems you aren&apos;t alone here after all.

Basecamp
You enter the door and come face-to-face (well, face-to-back) with a crowd of people, all of whom are looking intently towards the other side of the room.

You can see a refreshments table (on which are coffee, tea, a snack buffet, and a strange code fragment) and a Schedule board here.

Exits: south to Corridor - Westmost.

You greet the woman behind the registration desk.

&quot;Hello! What is it you need?&quot; she asks while sorting various items on the desk. 
She runs her finger along the badges, looking for yours.

&quot;Ah, here we go!&quot; she exclaims. &quot;This is your name, isn&apos;t it?&quot; She holds the lanyard up for you to see. You nod and she hands it over to you. &quot;A lot of the event rooms are on this floor - rooms 3A to 3E run from west to east along this corridor. The Venue is on the 1st floor, through the Gallery bar and I know that you&apos;ve already found the Basecamp. Enjoy the event!

You say goodbye and turn to leave but she stops you. &quot;Sorry, forgot to tell you something. We&apos;re just waiting on some more WiFi codes to be printed up, in case you wonder why you don&apos;t have one! It will come in time&quot;

He shrugs his shoulders a little. &quot;To be honest, they are all pretty much the same. Pick one, learn it by writing actual code and most importantly, find out about the libraries you should use and more importantly, the libraries you shouldn&apos;t. The best way you can do that is by chatting with your peers - you know, the people like you, doing similar things to you. You can learn the most from them.&quot;

He turns back to his laptop and opens yet another terminal on the screen - you could&apos;ve sworn you heard the laptop&apos;s fans sigh audibly. He brings up a python prompt and turns back to you. 

&quot;I have to say though, I have a real soft spot for python. Does the job, clear, easy, nice. Well worth putting time in learning. There&apos;s also javascript, which is a crucial language to know if you are building a web service.&quot;

Wow. That was pretty harsh. &quot;Er... okay, whatever.&quot; you reply. You had thought he would help a little more than that. You turn to leave.

&quot;Wait! I&apos;m kidding!&quot; he says. &quot;Ordinarily I&apos;d tell you to search for that online, as you&apos;ll find some of the best material there, like &quot;Dive into Python&quot;, but look around you. There&apos;s a ton of collective python experience here, the kind of experience that make the difference between searching for hours or having an issue sorted out with a quick chat.&quot; He &quot;alt-tab&apos;s back to a browser window. &quot;In fact, I think there is a python workshop due to start soon if you are keen. It&apos;s taking place next door in room 3B. Just remember, it&apos;s the community of people that makes a language great, not the other way around. Ask questions, get involved. As with anything, you get out from it more than what you put it, but you have to put something in first!&quot;

Ground floor stairs
In the low-light of the stairwell, you see a set of sharp-angled stairs spiralling upwards, fenced in by a utilitarian handrail, supported by thin banisters. The parts of the walls you can see are the kind of beige colour that cannot be described accurately without the words &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;depressing&quot;. It won&apos;t be how the colour is officially labelled, but labels are rarely honest. The noise from the rest of the building provides a background hum of activity. 

The only way is UP! (or something like that.) 

There is a message board lining the walls of the stairwell.

Exits: up and south to ULU Entrance.

Basecamp
You enter the door and come face-to-face (well, face-to-back) with a crowd of people, all of whom are looking intently towards the other side of the room.

You can see Mahendra Mahey here.

Exits: south.

It seems that things are just about to start, so you press forward to get a decent enough view. You manoeuvre through the throng of developers, hackers, academics and other delegates as politely as you can until you manage to get a view of the organiser who is just about to speak.

&quot;Welcome! Thank you all for coming to this, the fourth Dev8D! The fourth! There are a lot of new faces out there which is excellent, great to see and I also see many people I&apos;ve met before, which is doubly excellent! Helping people meet up and talk about the things that interest or even stump you is one of the key reasons this event exists. Many of you work in small teams and can feel isolated. Sometimes you alone are the team!&quot;

You hear quite a few knowing laughs from the people in the crowd. Seems you aren&apos;t alone here after all. (Maybe you should put that master sword back where you found it, eh?).

Basecamp
Normal BASECAMP DESC.

You can see a refreshments table (on which are coffee, tea, a snack buffet, and a strange code fragment), a Schedule board, and Mahendra Mahey here.

Corridor - Middle
You turn left into a small open area alongside a beige-coloured corridor, the same disappointing shade as that used in the stairwell. There is a busy woman sat behind a cluttered desk. To the south you can see the doors to rooms 3C and 3D.  The corridor continues east towards a set of closed doors, and west, towards what sounds like the rest of the conference.

You say goodbye and turn to leave but she stops you. &quot;Sorry, forgot to tell you something. We&apos;re just waiting on some more WiFi codes to be printed up, in case you wonder why you don&apos;t have one! It will come in time&quot;

You try to remain calm, forcing yourself not to panic. You note with some horror that your phone can barely pick up Edge inside the building. Edge! A pair of paper cups and some string provides better connectivity than that!

Ground floor stairs
In the low-light of the stairwell, you see a set of sharp-angled stairs spiralling upwards, fenced in by a utilitarian handrail, supported by thin banisters. The parts of the walls you can see are the kind of beige colour that cannot be described accurately without the words &quot;institutional&quot; and &quot;depressing&quot;. It won&apos;t be how the colour is officially labelled, but labels are rarely honest. The noise from the rest of the building provides a background hum of activity. 

The only way is UP! (or something like that.)
